# MatchingRhythm
Dating apps, which is now in fashion, inspired me to make this rhythm game.
In those kind of apps, people can judge people just based on their appearance easily and quickly, and this system reminds me of the rhythm games in which the players cope with the notes quickly.

So, in this game, the notes with people's face go down to the music and the players are required to cope with the notes based on their face.
If the appearance is good, swipe to the right, and vice versa.

Let's play!!!
